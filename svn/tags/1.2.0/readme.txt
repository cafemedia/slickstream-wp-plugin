Slickstream makes it easy to upgrade your site search. Get beautiful as-you-type search, relevant content recommendations, user favorites and more!

== Description ==

At Slickstream, we believe that giving website visitors a great experience is the best way to steadily build traffic volume over time. That's why we make it easy for publishers to add world-class search and engagement tools without a complicated technical integration or lengthy onboarding.

This plugin is for users of the [Slickstream Engagement Suite](https://bloggers.slickstream.com) and [Slickstream for Business](https://business.slickstream.com/). It adds our embed code to your pages and registers tools that you can place anywhere on your pages. Subscriptions start at $10/mo, and we offer a [completely free 30-day trial](https://bloggers.slickstream.com/get-slick) that doesn’t even require a credit card.

Slickstream users get unlimited access to all of our tools, including:
- Responsive *as-you-type search* with a heap of advanced features that your visitors will love
- Customizable *recommendation carousels and grids* backed by real data
- Hassle-free *content favoriting* to keep your visitors coming back
- A robust *analytics portal* with engagement insights you can actually use

## The Slickstream Difference

We sit outside of WordPress, which means when you sign up we build a model of your site and use it to populate all of our search and recommendation tools. Then you pick the ones you want to use, flip a switch, and we’re live! Your site can be running Slickstream tomorrow, with no complicated technical implementation required.

== FAQ ==

= What’s Included With the 30-Day Free Trial? =
Everything! When you sign up for our free 30-day trial, we set your website up with the tools you want, at zero cost to you — we won’t even ask for your credit card information up front. If for any reason you don’t like it, you can cancel at any point during your 30-day trial without paying a dime.

If you decide to subscribe, you will need to provide a credit card at that point. You will not be charged for any previous usage — instead, starting one month later, you will be charged based on actual traffic volume during that month.

= Do You Support Languages Other Than English? =
Yes we do. Our underlying recommendation technology is not English-specific, and we have already localized the Engagement Suite for German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, French, Norwegian, Swedish, Croatian, Russian, Danish, Arabic, Hebrew, Japanese and more. [Reach out to us](https://www.slickstream.com/contact) and we can confirm if we support your language too.

= How Long Will Slickstream Take to Set Up? =
Your site can be running Slickstream tomorrow, without any complicated technical implementation. Once you've been approved for a trial, we’ll get your site ready to go within hours.

= How Do I Get Started? =
It’s simple: [sign up for your free trial here](https://bloggers.slickstream.com/get-slick), and we’ll send you a pre-configured demo page. Then just install the plugin, review and adjust your settings, and go live!
